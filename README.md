# ChatGPT-data-analysis
ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI. Since it was launched in late 2022, it has gained popularity among the general population. A debate about whether ChatGPT should be allowed is ongoing among academics.

Objective:
Design a survey, post it online (hardcopy is acceptable but you will need to enter the data manually), share it with individuals in academia, and write about results.
The objective of this assignment is to measure opinion about the use of ChatGPT by students and whether universities should allow it or not. If yes, under what conditions (if any)? If not, why not?

I used at least five dependent variable questions and five independent variable questions. The dependent variable questions ask about the topic, while the independent variable questions ask about demographic information (e.g., age, occupation, gender, etc.). The sample size was over 100 people.

I Compiled/Analyzed the collected data from the survey and generated relevant figures/charts/tables using Python programming language.
